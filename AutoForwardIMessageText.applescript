# AutoForwardIMessageText.applescript
# - Supports 2-way relaying of iMessage to/from another chat service
# - To send iMessage, each outgoing iMessage must be formatted as: "[iMessage destination] Message"

# You can enumerate all your chat accounts on Messages like this:
(*
tell application "Messages"
get name of every service
end tell
*)
# Example result: {"Bonjour", "Facebook Chat", "AIM", "E:you@me.com"}

# What's your iMessage/iCloud/Apple ID? Note the format
# This must be the same as what's listed under Accounts
property myIMsgService : "E:myIMessage@me.com"

# Remember the iMessage that just came in
property recvService : ""
property recvText : ""
property recvBuddy : ""

# Account to use for forwarding
# (This is the "friendly" name in the Accounts list)
property fwdService : "Fowarding Chat Acct"

# The buddy to receive the forwarded message - presumably your primary chat acct
# To send to an SMS, enter as format "+15555551212"
property fwdServiceBuddy : "myPrimary@gmail.com"

# What ultimately gets forwarded
