AutoForwardIMessage
===================

A very simple AppleScript to help those who have to juggle between Android and iPhone...
- Forwards incoming and outgoing iMessage texts to any account of choice

To install
==========
- Register the script as in https://46b.it/2012/hacking-with-imessage

Note
====
- Supports two-way iMessage forwarding.
- Only works if Messages app is running.
- Only supports text iMessages. Pictures, movies won't work. Presumably, not all iOS emoji will work either.
- It seems that Messages sometimes doesn't fire "Message Received" event for some reason - known issue?
